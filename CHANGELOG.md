# Changelog

- **2026-11-08** -- engine patch 0113, `THINK_OFF_SPLIT` (default 1024, `TF_THINK_OFF_SPLIT`): with thinking off,
  GLM-5.3 sometimes drafts in its hidden-reasoning voice anyway ("We need ... Let's extract.") and writes `</think>`
  before its answer, so the draft and the marker were the reply's content. A thinking-off chat reply that writes the
  close token within its first `THINK_OFF_SPLIT` tokens now has the text before it as `reasoning_content` and the
  text after it as `content`, as a thinking reply does. A streamed reply's content waits until the token, the end or
  the hold, so streamed and whole replies split alike; a close after the hold stays text; raw completions, the JSON
  channel and logprobs requests are never split; `0` is off. sparkDash long-32k-2 (thinking off, 1,024 tokens): a
  505-token draft in `reasoning_content`, `content` the 16 lines and no `</think>`, 16/16, streamed and whole
  identical; long-32k-1 (no draft) unchanged. sparkDash QA, arith, MMLU (thinking off) and track (thinking on), 515
  replies, byte-identical to the runs before: no reply there closes a think block. Scores do not change (sparkDash
  already scores the text after `</think>`); the draft still costs its tokens. Tests: `think_off_split.zig` (the
  decision) and `think_off_split_test.zig` (the chat route, whole and streamed, token by token and batched: a closed
  draft splits, an ordinary or longer-than-the-hold reply and a late close are unchanged, the setting off is as
  before, thinking replies split as before), `zig build test-think-off-split-host`; the server suite
  (`test-server-cpu`, 895 tests) passes. README: the setting, the patch row, a troubleshooting row.
- **2026-11-08** -- engine patch 0111: the image build's nvcc prints no compiler warning. A clean-machine build showed
  49 warning lines that the builds in docs/speed's logs had carried for days: two fp8 expert prompt kernels declared a
  kernel-local `RW` their bodies never read, `prefill_attention.cu`'s `SMEM_MAX` had no reader anywhere,
  `glm_mm.cu`'s `Tile` kept an `SMEM` member no instantiation uses, and `flashnext_fact.cu` / `flashnext_attn.cu`
  held `#pragma unroll` loops behind an `if constexpr` branch whose taken side made them unreachable (nvcc #128-D,
  once per such kernel). The declarations are gone; the two loops sit behind an inverted `if constexpr` (the
  `flashnext_fact` wrap covers the rest of its iteration's scales, rows and epilogue), so each instantiation compiles
  only the side it can reach. No kernel's arithmetic, launch shape or output changes: all six files' fatbins compile
  byte-identical to the unpatched build (nvcc 13.3, sm_121), and every fatbin of the recipe's build now compiles
  warning-free.
- **2026-11-07** -- The pair serves `SERVE_EXTRA_ARGS='--top-k 20'` (in its `scripts/local.sh`): a request that
  sends no `top_k` was drawn from the whole top-p 0.95 nucleus of `generation_config.json` (temperature 1.0, top_p
  0.95, no top_k: `serve`'s `--top-k` is unset by default), where the old deployment used 20. Raised by raw, malformed
  tool-call markup in an agent turn (`<arg_key>` straight after the tool name) on the 2x RTX PRO 6000 bundle with the
  Ablit weights; a seed replay there was said to show a rank-252 draw. **Not reproduced on this pair, so the fix is a
  mitigation and the cause is unproven**: 520 sampled agent-shaped requests (text, then a tool call; 400 thinking off,
  120 thinking on) came back 520 correct with no `top_k`, and 520 with `top_k 20` likewise; `logprobs` are refused
  by this backend, so a draw's rank cannot be read here. Copying a tool-call markup line 30 times broke 30% of lines
  greedily and 33-36% sampled, with `top_k 20` or `min_p 0.001` or neither, the same lines at the same seeds, so those
  breaks are the model's own choices (they went away with `EFFORT_LINE=thinking`, below). With it set: greedy hashes
  unchanged (`00ca87eb05ae` / `c88e25e03b02` / `650453259cef`); T=0.7 prose decode 39.2 tok/s at one stream and 81.4
  at four against 40.2 / 80.1 with `top_k: 0` sent, the same within run spread (6 runs each); startup line 4,098 pages
  and a 3.1 GiB cache.
- **2026-11-07** -- `start.sh`: an exported `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` that is an NCCL exclusion list (`^lo,docker,...`,
  often from `/etc/profile.d`) no longer stops the start with `E_CONFIG`; it is set aside with a `W_CONFIG` warning and
  the link is found as when empty (issue 17, mjjjjaazing). Test: `scripts/tests/nccl-ifname.sh`.
- **2026-11-07** -- engine patch 0112, `EXTRA_EOS` (default `<|assistant|>`, `TF_EXTRA_EOS`): tokens that end a reply
  besides the checkpoint's EOS ids. GLM-5.3's `generation_config.json` lists `<|endoftext|>`, `<|user|>` and
  `<|observation|>` (154820, 154827, 154829) but not `<|assistant|>` (154828), which the model can write to close a
  reply: the token then reached the reply as text and the model wrote its whole reply again until the length cap.
  sparkDash's 32k needle item long-32k-2 at 1,024 tokens: before, 1,024 tokens (`length`), the answer, the token and a
  second copy of the reply; with the patch, 630 tokens, `stop`, 16/16, the token gone. Its own 512-token run still
  scores 1/16: with thinking off the model drafts all 16 codes (correctly) in the reply before the answer, which the
  cap cuts after one line. Recall itself is exact: both 32k items list the 16 codes and 4 corrections right. QA and
  arith rerun (190 items, `DENSE=bf16`) byte-identical to the run before. A name the tokenizer does not hold stops
  the start; `EXTRA_EOS=none` keeps the checkpoint's list. README: the setting, the patch row, a troubleshooting row.
- **2026-11-07** -- `scripts/tests/patch-numbers.sh`: a number in `patches/engine/` names one patch, checked by
  `scripts/tests/run.sh` (issue 15, travellingsoldier85's check). README: with `CACHE_FIRST=1`, `PROMPT_CACHE_GIB` is a
  priority, not a floor, and a larger ask can fund more cache by costing the streams a window (issue 16, jds1-ai's
  arms and formula; laidick); troubleshooting rows for an exported `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` exclusion list (issue 17,
  mjjjjaazing) and for clones from before the 2026-11-04 history (issue 16); the Ablit weights' drafter cost depends
  on the memory plan (issue 17). From outside PRs: `cache-replay.py` names warm turns 0104 and sends `SERVED_NAME`
  (#12), the settings table's `HEAD` and `REASONING_EFFORT` defaults (#13), and the startup check's page count with
  `CACHE_FIRST=1` (#14), all by travellingsoldier85.
- **2026-11-07** -- `PROMPT_CACHE_MIN_GIB`, opt-in (empty by default; #21 by laidick): `start.sh` reads the prompt cache each rank's
  startup line funds and, before LIVE, stops both ranks with `E_CACHE` when one funds less. `PROMPT_CACHE_GIB` caps
  the cache but does not guarantee it, even with `CACHE_FIRST=1`: the cache is what that start's room leaves after the
  streams' windows, and the room moved between 17.8 and 18.9 GiB across starts with no config change (issue 16,
  jds1-ai). "no prompt cache" and a cache in host memory count as 0 on the device; a rank 0 log with no startup line
  stops the start; rank 1, which follows rank 0's plan and prints no startup line on the pair, is checked only when
  its log has one. Test:
  `scripts/tests/cache-min.sh` (startup lines in the engine's formats, ranks stubbed), run by `scripts/tests/run.sh`.
  On the pair: `PROMPT_CACHE_MIN_GIB=1` starts (rank 0 funds 3.1 GiB), `=20` stops both ranks with `E_CACHE`.
- **2026-11-06** -- engine patch 0110: `KV_SHARD=1` (`TF_GLM_KV_SHARD`), opt-in (#24), KV sharding at TP=2 by
  Robert Wojciechowski ([@wojo](https://github.com/wojo), X [@rwojo](https://x.com/rwojo)), toward upstream [#1431](https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold/issues/1431). Each stream's FP8
  latent rows live on its owner Spark alone, so the pool holds about twice the tokens (4,098 to 8,196 pages at the
  defaults). On the pair: every greedy reply identical to unsharded across eight request sets (1-8 concurrent
  streams, eight 30k contexts, a 102.5k conversation); decode -1.6% at one stream, -3.6% aggregate at eight; cold
  first token unchanged; `tf-cuda-test glm-kv-shard-check` byte-identical to an unsharded twin over 10 paths, kept
  states through the disk image included. With `CACHE_FIRST=1 PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=6 LEARN_GIB=30`: a 4.1 GiB cache and
  3.15M tokens of pool a rank, and a 102.5k conversation resumed from disk after a restart in 1.13 s.
  Re-measured on the maintainer's pair (2026-11-07, image `8734689e7a73`, published weights): 6,147 pages and a
  4.3 GiB cache with `CACHE_FIRST=1 PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=6` (4,098 pages and 3.1 GiB unsharded); greedy hashes equal;
  decode 37.5 / 55.4 tok/s at one stream (prose / code; unsharded 38.3 / 56.4), 77-78 at four (79-80);
  `glm-kv-shard-check` passes on both ranks (10 paths, 510 rows); an 18k and a 101k conversation resume from disk
  after a restart under sharding with the in-memory reply.
- **2026-11-06** -- engine patch 0109: `LEARN_GIB` (`--learn-conversations`), opt-in (#22), a backport of upstream
  [#1411](https://github.com/ashhart/TensorFold/pull/1411) by Robert Wojciechowski ([@wojo](https://github.com/wojo), X [@rwojo](https://x.com/rwojo)). Kept prompt states also go to disk on
  the head Spark, every rank's part, so conversations survive eviction and restarts. On the pair at the served
  `PARALLEL=8` and 1M window: off, greedy hashes equal main's (6 of 6) and decode is unchanged (35.07 against 34.60
  tok/s, 1,024 tokens); on, an 18.7k-token turn resumes after a restart in 1.9 s (cold 10.7 s), after an eviction in
  2.5 s, queued behind a 52k-token prompt with its state read ahead, and with `"draft": false`; a 102.5k-token one
  after a restart in 1.8 s (cold 58.4 s); every reply equal to the in-memory resume. Damaged state or block files are
  refused and the turn prefills. Writing a state costs a stream decoding beside it about 1%. Host tests: the disk image
  round trip on a device-only lease and on one that runs onto 0015's host pages.
  Re-measured on the maintainer's pair (2026-11-07): off, all greedy hashes, the startup line (4,098 pages, 3.1 GiB)
  and decode (38.3 / 56.4 at one stream, 79-80 at four) equal main's; on (`LEARN_GIB=30`), after a full restart a
  101.5k-token conversation resumes 98,304 tokens cached (first token 3.6 s) and an 18.6k one 16,384, both replies
  byte-identical to the in-memory resume; rank 1 logs clean.
- **2026-11-06** -- the two thinking-on items the native image lost against v0.6.0's run (sparkDash arith-31,
  gsm8k-1176: arith 39/40, GSM8K 194/200 against 40/40 and 195/200) are the dense weights' width, not the drafter.
  With `DRAFTER=none` both replies are token-identical to the drafted ones (316 and 1,913 tokens, the same wrong
  answers), so DFlash2's verification is lossless there. With `DENSE=bf16` (the drafter on), the arith and GSM8K
  categories rerun at 40/40 and 195/200, and those two are the only items whose verdict changes against the q8
  run: no new failures. Both are precision-sensitive traces (a carried intermediate at step 7; a second-guessed
  interpretation), so q8 costs two items of 240 here for its measured speed (docs/speed/RESULTS.md: bf16 dense
  30.5 / 46.5 tok/s at one stream against q8's 39.0 / 57.3, 70 against 78-80 at four). `DENSE=q8` stays the
  default; `DENSE=bf16` is the setting for exact dense weights. An fp8 dense path (v0.6.0's `DENSE=fp8`) would be
  a byte a weight like q8 with 3 mantissa bits against q8's 7 over groups of 64, so it is not pursued.
- **2026-11-06** -- `EFFORT_LINE=thinking` (default; #23 by wagzee): the template's `<|system|>Reasoning Effort: Max` line with
  thinking on only, as TensorFold v0.6.0's recipe wrote it; `always` serves the template as it is. The checkpoint's
  template (and the vision copy) sets the line to Max unless a request's effort is low or high, so every prompt
  carried it, thinking off included (7 tokens; `/tokenize` on a one-line user message: 27 against 20), and a
  thinking-off reply reasoned in its answer. `start.sh` writes the chosen template to `.state/chat_template.jinja`
  with its second line taking the effort from `reasoning_effort`, which the engine passes with thinking on and
  leaves null with thinking off (prompt.zig), and serves that copy on both ranks; a template without the line the
  checkpoint ships stops the start (`E_CONFIG`); `DRY_RUN=1` checks and writes nothing. Measured with sparkDash's
  quality suite on this pair (755 items, greedy, fixed seed, `PARALLEL=4 KV=bf16`), the same image: QA 79.3% (119/150)
  -> **86.0%** (129/150), the five "binary representation, digits only" items that ran out of their 64 tokens
  mid-division and the four transposed string reversals answered as v0.6.0's run did (140 of 150 QA replies
  byte-identical to that run, served `DENSE=fp8`); MMLU 91.2% (260/285) -> 88.4% (252/285), the line's visible
  reasoning no longer helping the thinking-off letters (v0.6.0's run: 88.1%); reason, arith, track and GSM8K
  byte-identical to the run before (their prompts think, so the line stays). No reply ends on `length` any more.
  README: the setting, "The effort line", a troubleshooting row.
  Checked on the pair (2026-11-07): a one-line thinking-off prompt is 8 tokens instead of 15, thinking on 14 both
  ways; "binary representation of 217, digits only" at 64 tokens answers `11011001` (it ran out of tokens before);
  the thinking-on greedy hash is unchanged (`650453259cef`). Copying a tool-call markup line 30 times with thinking
  off went from 30-36% malformed lines (greedy included, `top_k` 20 or not) to 3 of 1,419.
- **2026-11-06** -- engine patch 0108: `CACHE_FIRST=1` (`TF_PROMPT_CACHE_FIRST`), opt-in. The pool counted the room in
  whole windows before the prompt cache, so `PROMPT_CACHE_GIB` only capped the remainder (issue 7: crystal8194,
  tanchunsiong, unitea1992; issue 3). With it, the cache is set aside first and the streams share the pages left, one
  window at least. On the pair at `PARALLEL=8` and the 1M window with `PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=12`: a 9.3-9.7 GiB cache; a
  380k-token conversation resumes 99% cached after eight ~31k ones (3.0 s instead of 234 s) and all eight resume;
  hashes and decode unchanged; three concurrent agent loops as fast. Off, the plan is as before. The startup log says
  when the room funds less cache than `--prompt-cache-gib` asks, and names what frees more (tanchunsiong's
  suggestion). README: the long-session setting is now `CACHE_FIRST=1 PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=12` at eight streams.
  `WITH_VIDEO=1`, opt-in: `docker/Dockerfile` builds `libtfvideo.so` over upstream's static FFmpeg 9.0.2 into its own
  image tag (the default image and its tag are unchanged), so `VISION=1` serves `video_url` parts (issue 8, chai-md;
  checked: a three-colour clip described in order, text hashes unchanged). Issue 9 (pepelaskov): the dropped digit
  reproduces on the Ablit weights only; the published weights copy the id exactly on the same image and request, and
  so do the Ablit weights with thinking on (README "Ablit weights").
- **2026-11-06** -- README: a measured setting for long agent sessions, `PARALLEL=2 CONTEXT=524288
  PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=32`. On the pair, a 382k-token conversation, then eight unique ~31k ones, then the long one's next
  turn: with this setting rank 0 funds a 12.4 GiB cache, the long turn resumes 100% cached (0.8 s instead of 237 s)
  and all eight short ones resume at 94%, with decode and greedy hashes unchanged. The served `PARALLEL=8` (3.4 GiB)
  resumes 1 of 8 and not the long one; `PARALLEL=4 PROMPT_CACHE_GIB=16`, with or without `CONTEXT=524288`
  (5.1-5.4 GiB), resumes 3-4 of 8 and not the long one. The trade is two streams at once; there is still no disk or
  host tier on GB10. Measured alongside, with no change taken: tool-eval-bench 2.8.0 `--hardmode`, 3 seeds, scores 88
  thinking off and 93 thinking on (reasoning high). A build with 2,048-row prompt chunks (without 0094/0095) has the
  same hashes and a shorter worst pause beside a long prefill (1.6 s against 2.7 s), but p95 pauses 10 times longer
  and three concurrent agent loops 3.6 times slower, so 4,096 rows stay.
- **2026-11-05** -- engine patch 0107: `TF_TOOL_CALL_GUARD=1`, opt-in. A Hermes agent showed raw
  `<tool_call>session_search<arg_key>…` text: its turn after two tool rounds was sent without `session_search`, and
  the server (as vLLM) keeps a call to a tool the request does not offer as text. With the guard, such a request gets a
  closing system note that tools are unavailable and the markup hidden (no tools, or `tool_choice: "none"`), or only
  the unoffered call hidden (other tools offered); streamed or whole. Measured on a live serve with the patch: off,
  every case replies as before and the greedy hashes are unchanged; on, no markup in 12 of 12 such replies (prose or
  empty), calls to offered tools still parse (4 of 4), hashes and speed unchanged. README: the patch row and a
  troubleshooting row.
- **2026-11-05** -- the memory guard `start.sh` leaves running holds none of the caller's stdin, stdout or stderr: it
  kept the pipe of `ssh spark './start.sh'` open, so that ssh session never returned after LIVE (issue 7, crystal8194).
  Its one message now goes to `memguard.log` in the run directory (it went to the terminal and the log). A test,
  `scripts/tests/memguard-detached.sh`, reads the guard's descriptors from /proc; `scripts/tests/run.sh` runs the
  syntax check, shellcheck when installed, and the tests.
- **2026-11-05** -- README: the prompt cache is funded from the remainder after the page pool and the streams' fixed
  parts, so `PROMPT_CACHE_GIB` only caps it (eight streams at 1M leave under 1 GiB; `PARALLEL=4` funds 8 GiB), the
  room differs by a few GiB between Sparks so the reserve that holds two windows is a per-pair check, hits land on the
  4,096-row chunk grid, and nothing survives a restart at this pin (issue 3: jds1-ai, micachi; issue 7: crystal8194).
  Video input: the template accepts `video_url` parts but the image ships no `libtfvideo.so`, so they return HTTP 500;
  the settings table, the "What is checked" line and a troubleshooting row say so, with the out-of-image build that
  works (issue 8, chai-md). Building the video runtime into the image is a Dockerfile change with an FFmpeg stage,
  not taken here.
- **2026-11-04** -- `WORKER_WEIGHTS=check` accepts a local checkpoint with no `.revision` marker when its config.json
  and shards are there, as `worker_weights_ready`'s comment always said; `MODEL_REVISION`'s default made the marker
  mandatory even for `MODEL_SOURCE=local` (issue 3, failure 1). The `E_WEIGHTS` hint names the marker.
- **2026-11-04** -- the worker's state paths (`WORKER_CACHE_DIR` and the state and overlay built on it) default under
  the worker's own home when its login differs from this Spark's and every default is untouched; an explicitly set
  path wins as before (issue 3, failure 2). The `E_START` failure to create the directory says what to set.
- **2026-11-04** -- `start.sh` runs rank 1 as the worker's own login when `CONTAINER_USER` is this Spark's (the default).
  With different ids on the two Sparks (uid 1000 and 1001 on ours), rank 1 could not write
  to its state folder and stopped at `hashing the checkpoint failed at model-00001-of-00083.safetensors` with
  `AccessDenied`. Equal ids, root and another `CONTAINER_USER` run as before; a `CONTAINER_USER` set to this Spark's own ids
  counts as the default. With different ids the start stops, with the fix, when a folder in rank 1's `HOME`
  (`WORKER_CACHE_DIR/home`) is not writable by that login, which a workaround that let an earlier rank write there can leave
  behind. A worker reading shards only the head's id can read (mode 0600 over NFS without `all_squash`) now needs shards its
  login can read.
- **2026-11-04** -- CREDITS and NOTICE: the Aevonix entry removed. On reflection it earns no line here: the serving scripts are
  this lab's own (Aevonix's recipe reworked the lab's GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-4x-DGX-Sparks-TensorFold scripts, and this recipe's
  copies reach it through the lab's 2x RTX PRO 6000 recipe), the banner was never theirs, and the lab's own 2x RTX PRO 6000
  repository keeps the credit where its scripts are Aevonix's rework outright. The one debt that survives is the K12 loop, now
  recorded where it is used: patch 0078's comment names patches/aevonix/0073 in Aevonix's
  GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-4x-RTX-PRO-6000-TensorFold (it said MiaAI-Lab/Aevonix, a repository that does not exist).
- **2026-11-04** -- CREDITS and NOTICE, the Aevonix entry corrected: it said this recipe's `start.sh`, `stop.sh`,
  `scripts/config.sh`, `scripts/prepare.sh` and `scripts/banner.sh` are adapted from Aevonix's 4x RTX PRO 6000 recipe, which
  states the direction backwards. The adaptation began from this lab's own scripts: Aevonix's NOTICE names the lab's
  `scripts/config.sh` and `start-tp4.sh` (GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-4x-DGX-Sparks-TensorFold, created 2026-10-01, the day before
  Aevonix's repository) as "the basis" of their `start.sh` and `scripts/config.sh`, and their `stop.sh` and
  `scripts/prepare.sh` as "adapted from Mia's scripts"; and `scripts/banner.sh` here is the lab's own art - the two-Spark and
  four-Spark recipes carry the same MIA AI LAB banner file and this recipe recolours it, while Aevonix's banner is their own
  artwork, so it never came from them. The old text also cited patch 0073 to "MiaAI-Lab/Aevonix", a repository that does not
  exist; the K12 loop patch 0078 follows is `patches/aevonix/0073` in Aevonix's repository. What survives of the credit: this
  recipe's four serving scripts do pass through Aevonix's rework (the 2x RTX PRO 6000 recipe adopted it - their texts are the
  closest matches to ours), so Aevonix stays credited for the intermediate rework and the K12 loop, as the reworker of the
  lab's scripts rather than their origin.
- **2026-11-04** -- Upstream TensorFold since this recipe's pin (`f350cd3e`, 1,059 commits behind main) was reviewed for
  fixes worth carrying (docs/speed/RESULTS.md, "Upstream since the pin"). The one that applied cleanly, the lane fix
  `ed39acc5a` (a stream finishing on its first token released its lane only after its trace), was built as `0106` and
  **killed on the pair**: with it, decode fell to 28 / 36 tok/s at one stream and 51-66 at four, with a connection and a
  waiter left open after twenty one-token replies; the same sequence on the 105-patch image is normal (38 / 57 / 78-80).
  Upstream's deferred release does not fit this stack's lane host (0093, 0104). The candidate stays in
  docs/speed/candidates as a record; the served image is the 105-patch `8c4ca7bd8c39`.
- **2026-11-04** -- `0105`: a tool parameter whose schema names no type (`{}`, a description alone, a `$ref` that resolves
  nowhere) takes the JSON object or array the model wrote instead of coming back as a JSON string of it; scalars, plain
  words and quoted strings stay text, and a tool declared without a parameter schema keeps streaming its arguments as
  before. The rule is the maintainer's from the 2x DGX Sparks recipe's issue #180 (upstream keeps untyped values as text);
  a union that admits an object already decoded one on this engine pin. Found by a sweep of the sibling repos' issues
  (docs/speed/RESULTS.md, "Sweep of the sibling repos"), reproduced here, host-tested (43 parser + 7 parameter tests).
- **2026-11-04** -- `0104`, warm turns for GLM (ported from the 2x RTX PRO 6000 recipe): after a reply the server prefills the
  next turn's rendering in the background (a prompt-only pass that steps aside for real work), so a user message after an
  agent loop resumes past the loop instead of re-reading it. Measured here (docs/speed/RESULTS.md): the next user message
  after a 9.3K-token tool loop cached 8,192 tokens (was 4,096), 1.6 s to answer (was 3.5 s); 17 of 18 passes stepped aside
  under back-to-back requests; first-token latency 0.15 s unchanged; decode 38.4 / 56.6 at 1 stream, 79-81 at 4 streams,
  greedy hashes unchanged. Each pass logs `next turn: background prefill of N tokens done` or `stepped aside`.
- **2026-11-04** -- `0103` (ported from the RTX recipe's `0096`, with a guard): a tool call that follows prose quoting
  tool-call markup ("Qwen's `<tool_call>{}`") is parsed as the call instead of coming back as content. The guard: an opener
  inside a value still open in the text before it (an unbalanced `{`, an open `<arg_value>` or `<parameter=`) is never
  retried - without it a call quoting a whole call inside a JSON string argument invoked the quoted call (found by Codex,
  confirmed by a host test). `zig build test-tool-parse-host`: 42 pass.
- **2026-11-04** -- `MEMORY_RESERVE_GIB` 8 -> 9.5 (scripts/local.sh): the prompt cache had silently gone to ZERO. The page
  planner takes whole 1M-token windows of pages before the cache, and the room (19.8 GiB at reserve 8, up from 18.2 the
  day before) crossed the threshold for a third window; rank 0 logged "no prompt cache" and every chat turn re-prefilled
  its history (6 s a turn at 9.3K tokens). At 9.5 the pool is two windows (4,098 pages, 2.1M tokens) and the cache 3.6 GiB;
  decode, prefill, mixed and 8-stream numbers unchanged, 1.5 GiB more free memory. Check rank 0's startup line after
  every start: "4098 pages", "prompt cache: N GiB", no "cannot keep one state" warning.
- **2026-11-04** -- Decode campaign items closed by measurement (docs/speed/RESULTS.md): KDA C1 (merging the KDA chain's
  launches) - fusion loses, dependent launches save ~0.2 ms a round, below the engine's resolution; the exact PDL
  variant is parked as candidate `0199` (opt-in `TF_GLM_PDL_CHAIN=...,kda`). Sampled decoding at temperature 0.7: this
  pair 36.7-38.9 tok/s at 1 stream and 75-76 at 4, the spark1+2 reference 21 and 30-31 (its round doubles under
  sampling); its 4-stream lead over this pair is greedy-only.
- **2026-11-03** -- `0099`: `TF_GLM_PROF=1` also brackets shared windows (several streams in one forward), reported as
  `glm prof shared N rows` by total rows; off unless set, no kernel or token change. With it, a 4-stream round is
  attributed (docs/speed/RESULTS.md, "Decode attribution campaign"): routed experts 4.2-5.8 ms a row at the GB10's
  memory bandwidth, KDA mixers 16-17 ms flat, drafter 7-8 ms. Two exact candidates measured neutral and parked in
  docs/speed/candidates: `0098` (`TF_GLM_DFLASH2_EDGE`) and `0100` (`TF_GLM_MM_STAGES`). The chain cut, the tpm rule,
  a bf16 drafter, bf16 dense and stock TensorFold v1.2.1 were all slower or equal; the numbers are in that section.
- **2026-11-03** -- `PREFILL_SHARE` (default `0.68`, passed to both ranks as `TENSORFOLD_PREFILL_SHARE`): a stream
  decoding beside another request's long prefill no longer gets one decode round per prompt chunk. A chunk is atomic
  (4,096 rows with 0094/0095, about 2.5 s here), and at the engine's default share of 1 a chat beside a long prefill
  produced a token or two per chunk. At `0.68` each chunk first owes the decoders about 1.2 s of decode rounds (~22),
  and the long prompt's first token comes about 47% later. Replies are byte-identical at any value: the share only
  moves when the next chunk runs. The rows in the README are the knob's arithmetic on this pair's measured chunk and
  round times; the mixed-traffic measurement is from the 2x RTX PRO 6000 recipe (2.3 -> 27.2 chat events/s during a
  cold 175K prefill, that prompt's first token 33.4 -> 49.8 s). `PREFILL_BUDGET` is passed as
  `TENSORFOLD_PREFILL_BUDGET` when set; it cannot split a chunk. Takes effect at the next `./start.sh restart`
  ([README](README.md#prefill-beside-decoding)).
